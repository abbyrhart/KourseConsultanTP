SOC 100: Principles of Sociology
Caleb Harris | Computer Science Engineering & Mathematics Minor
Take an intro sociology course imo. Sociology is fascinating and I absolutely loved SOC 100
MIDEAST 315: Introduction to Arab Culture
Aditya Ravi | Computer Science Engineering & Mathematics
Great class + not much workload


Areeb Khan | Computer Science & UX Design
Triple counts now which is so nice, really good class. Bardenstein is a very good prof. Mandatory attendance is the only annoying thing (-1% on ur grade for every discussion missed)
MIDEAST 326: Introduction to Arab-Israeli Conflict in Literature & Film
Aditya Ravi | Computer Science Engineering & Mathematics
Fall 2019. Strongly recommend this class! Professor Bardenstein is an amazing teacher and I learned so much about a topic I didn't know anything about going in. 
MUSICOL 346: History of Music
Advay Muchoor | Computer Science Engineering & Mathematics Minor
MUSICOL 346 is a neat class. There are a couple different sections - the popular ones are Music in Science Fiction Films/TV and Bollywood Music. Both sections aren't too much work and fairly interesting.

Michelle Liu | Computer Science Engineering 
I took MUSICOLOGY 346 which I don't know if they offer all the time but its Music in Science Ficiton. I took it with Jessica Getman and she is fantastic. I think music is cool but the most I had ever done musically was play in high school band, and she made me really interested in how music is composed for what types of feelings. really chill and straightforward, there is some "write about what you think about this" busy work but not too bad at all and you get to watch movies 
PHIL 355: Contemporary Moral Problems
Fizza Ahmed | Data Science - LSA
not too hard of a class, readings are short, and you spend class and discussion talking about the arguments behind modern day issues like abortion, gun control, and affirmative action. everyone is very respectful and i like talking in discussions so this was fun for me.
RCHUMS 334: Topics in Humanities
Kelley Sweitzer | UX Design & Computer Science Minor
Memoir writing class I really enjoyed! If you're into creative writing, it's a super cool class and a good time. From what I've heard, anything in the RC is a solid bet because the professors are so nice and accommodating to your schedule.
GERMAN 386: Fairy Tales
Anonymous | Computer Science Engineering & Creative Writing Minor
German Fairytales was a really cool and interesting class. There’s only one major essay to write and you spend most of your time just reading fairytales. The class is simple and the midterm and final only require an hour or two of studying. Cool class that won’t take up too much of your time! 
ASIAN 325: Zen: History, Culture, and Critique
Pibby Garrahan | Computer Science Engineering & Music Minor 
I took Zen Buddhism and it was wack. It was a super easy class but I wanted to get a lot more out of it than I did.
MUSICOL 123: Introduction to Popular Music
Pibby Garrahan | Computer Science Engineering & Music Minor 
Musicology 123 and PAT 201- my two favorite classes at Michigan. Musicology is amazing for anyone interested in the history of music and PAT 201 was how I started to learn how to use Abelton to make electronic music and it was sick. 
PAT 201: Introduction to Computer Music

COMM 306: Survey of Media Topics in the Humanities
Anonymous | Economics & Complex Systems Minor
Representing American Jewishness was an Easy A that opened my eyes to other views of American Jewishness. Easy writing class and a great way to meet other students in all different majors. Great experience!


ENVIRON 357: Architecture, Sustainability and the City
Christian Wong | Computer Science Engineering & Business + Sustainability Minor
As a sustainability minor who wanted to actually learn from this class, it's not the best class because it's kind of all over the place with concepts and is very slow to get to the point. However, it is also incredibly easy and I have no idea why it's even a humanities class (but I'll take it). Class has no exams and the lectures are optional (there's interactive lecture quizzes once a week that are very easy though). Grade is based on discussion attendance (discussion is actually interesting) and 9 assignments throughout the semester (4 readings and 5 assignments that have like 400-500 word responses for each assignment)
CLCIV 385: Greek Mythology
Anonymous | Computer Science Engineering & Applied Statistics Minor
Super chill class, all you do is read myths (which are kinda sick) and talk about them in discussion. There are some essays and I think a midterm and final but they're cake, just have a vague idea of what the myths are about. For reference, I read maybe 2 out of the many myths we were supposed to read and did fine on exams.
Miscellaneous Advice
Anonymous | Computer Science Engineering
If you're engineering, here's another option that I did: take a 100 or 200 level humanities if you find one that really piques your interest, and take a 300+ level social science instead. I took a 300 level psych class about social development that I enjoyed a ton (shelly schreier is the GOAT), and a 100 level linguistics class called "epic grammar fails" that started with lighthearted topics like boomers not knowing modern day text etiquette all the way to how much racism and classism is built into English and the way we use it, and discussing some word origins.

SOCIAL SCIENCES
ECON 101: Microeconomics
Aditya Ravi | Computer Science Engineering & Mathematics
Decently easy class with Caldwell
________________
Ishan Thaker | Computer Science Engineering & Economics Minor
ECON 101 - Loved this class, this class is what got me hooked into my Econ minor. Caldwell is a really good prof. Not a blowoff by any means, but if you apply yourself and stay on top of stuff, you will be fine for exams and quizzes. I took this with 203 and engr 100.

Carma Abu-Elnaj | CS/Cogsci -LSA
Took if out of curiosity and lowkey had to work more than I expected to. I had dudley so we had 5 “quizes” that were essentially exams (lowest one is dropped), and two mwrites. Not too difficult material and he was a decent lecturer just the number of quizzes was a lot lowkey. 
ECON 102: Macroeconomics
Ishan Thaker | Computer Science Engineering & Economics Minor
ECON 102 - Loved this class, I took this class with Professor Cho who is an amazing prof. The lectures were short and easy to understand and they give a ton of practice problems and exams so that made it manageable. The exams are worth about 90% of your grade (at least for Cho) so that was the only downside, but other than that it's a great course to take if you need electives and want to learn more about macro
ENVIRON 208: Business and the Natural Environment
Christian Wong | Computer Science Engineering & Business + Sustainability Minor
One of the best classes I've taken at UMich. Would highly recommend if you hate big corporations as much as I do. You learn a ton about how businesses do both good and bad things for the environment and you just become much more conscious of the impact of businesses. You will learn a ton from the class and I highly recommend it
ENVIRON 370: Urban Planning & the Environment
Christian Wong | Computer Science Engineering & Business + Sustainability Minor
Super interesting first-level urban planning class. You learn a lot about how urban spaces work. I also have a 80 page notes document for the entire course content. Professor changed though so I'm not 100% sure if it's the same content.

NATURAL SCIENCES
ASTRO 101: The Solar System and the Search for a new Earth
Aditya Ravi | Computer Science Engineering & Mathematics
Fun class

Alyssa Russell | Information Analysis & Interdisciplinary Astronomy
TAKE ASTRO CLASSESSSSS they're so fun and the lower level ones are usually not too difficult, especially astronomy courses. You also get to use the telescope and planetarium in angell hall in ASTRO 101. Great class. Take it.

Okay it was fun but the labs made me feel like I was back in middle school lowkey which was a little boring tho not difficult. Weekly work but it wasn’t hard and material was generally interesting. 
ASTRO 206: Black Holes: The Triumph of Gravity
Aditya Ravi | Computer Science Engineering & Mathematics
Physics/heavy but fun
EARTH 113: Planets and Moons
Anonymous | Economics & Complex Systems Minor
Mini-course that is too easy. One quiz every week that’s 10 questions long. Takes the best 4 out of 5 quizzes. All open notes and he posts nice, short lectures. If you need to satisfy that LSA Req or need to stretch one more credit in a semester, take this!

RACE & ETHNICITY
EDUC 118: Introduction to Education
Sydney Bruce | UX Design & Business Minor
EDUC 118 is a great race & ethnicity course! I took it my freshman year and loved the content and the professor. The course gave me a deeper understanding and historical background of our education system. Great for any one, but will be super interesting for those that have a passion for education.
WGS 240: Introduction to Women's and Gender Studies
Lucas Felpi | Computer Science - LSA
Taken WGS 240 Winter 2021. Really recommend it, it is a very interesting class that touches on gender, sexuality, race, and much more in a very distinct perspective. It is not supposed to be hard, it is made for you to succeed with different extra credit opportunities and flexible deadlines. Overall a very different type of class, I enjoyed it a lot.
ITALIAN 240 Italian Mafia
Anonymous | Computer Science - LSA
Taking Italian Mafia for R & E credit now. It's really interesting, fun, and easy to do well in. It can be boring at times in lecture but that's not the end of the world. Workload is very light.

STATISTICS
STATS 250: Introduction to Statistics and Data Analysis
Aditya Ravi | Computer Science Engineering & Mathematics
Took in Winter 2019. Much easier if you have taken AP Stats in high school. 
________________


Sydney Bruce | UX Design & Business Minor
STATS 250: (Taken winter 2019) This is a pre-req for SI so make sure you get this out of the way early. This is your basic statistics class that covers a lot of baseline information. This class does require a lot of attention and making sure you keep up with what is being taught. I have heard they might be changing the way this class is laid out, but I personally found it helpful to study with others and make sure you know the material. I had Gunderson who was an angel, but she retired.

Taken this class Fall 2020. It did not feel like a hard class, the material is interesting and engaging, and the instructional team is very understanding and wants you to succeed. It has a large amount of assignments and heavy workload embedded to it, but they are not always hard in essence. I don’t think you will have a hard time going through it!
________________
Anonymous | Computer Science Engineering & Creative Writing Minor
Personally, I’m not a fan of Statistics in general. Stats 250 is a very easy class if you just watch lecture once (I couldn’t even bring myself to do that and I did just fine). The homeworks can be a little tricky but they usually help you right away in OH and they have OH around the clock all week long. 
________________
Julie Frary | Information Analysis & Applied Statistics Minor
250 always has mixed reviews, but in my opinion I did not think it was too bad. I definitely think having some sort of background in statistics is beneficial for this class. I also did a lot of the learning on my own, considering Romero was not the best lecturer. 
________________

Took this with Queen Gunderson. She retired, but she always said to review often and be committed to a study schedule in order to have success in her class. Work with other students! Everyone’s probably concerned with their performance in that class, so study together and often.
________________
Anonymous | UX Design & Entrepreneurship Minor
I took this class Fall 2019. I really like the subject but I did not like my professor - I believe her name was Professor Fink. However, they do upload other professors lectures online which as MUCH easier to follow. For this class, if you did not take stats in high school, it is imperative that you follow along and stay updated with the material because each concept builds on the previous and the exams really test your application skills and knowledge. I would also take time to actually do the homework (not rushed at the deadline) because it is really useful for the exams in my opinion. 
________________
Ishan Thaker | Computer Science Engineering & Economics Minor
I took this class in the winter during COVID year and it was pretty straightforward. I'd say the workload is a bit high every week with a lab and homework (pretty lengthy too) due every week. But if you just stay on top of your stuff for this class and complete homework, you'll be perfectly fine for the exams. I took this class with 280 and ECON 102 and I thought it was manageable.
________________
Maya Chalker | Information Analysis & Business Minor
Take Stats 250 with Gunderson - she's the only way to go if you want to actually understand. Also do homework in office hours. Everyone just sits there working on it together (even if you don't know them) and GSIs confirm correct answers.

Anonymous | Computer Science - LSA
Stats 250 is an easy class. If you do the work and understand the problems on the practice exam, it is an easy class. Get practice exams from upperclassmen and just run through a few of them. The problems that show up on the exam are quite literally the same procedure but with a different situation and numbers. In my experience taking the class, the homework is easy but slightly tedious, the exams are not terrible - I got a 99 on the final, just studying practice exams. I personally got an A+ in the class and I felt like I wasn't the strongest Stats student in my class either. 
________________


Anonymous | Computer Science - LSA
Stats 250 is not bad especially if you have already taken some stats before. If you haven’t I would recommend just staying on top of the material and not falling behind as the material builds on itself and can get hard when it compounds. The exams aren’t too bad if you stay on top of your work and do practice problems. The homework is not hard just a lot of time. Some portions are still online like the quizzes and the exams which is nice but probably depends on the semester going forward. Generally an easy enough class just don’t fall behind and lowkey go to lab because they help you through the HW and labs a lot. 
STATS 412: Introduction to Probability & Statistics
Annika Dahlmann | Data Science - LSA & Spanish
Took Stats 412 Winter 2019. Really really enjoyed this class. I had taken AP stats in high school so I had a baseline, but I don't think this was necessary to understand the material throughout the class. I took this class pre-covid and there was an option to attend the lectures live from anywhere (which I'm sure they'll continue when things return to in person too). I had Jack Miller and they were such an amazing professor. Really good at teaching clearly. This class now requires calc 3 as a pre-req (didn't when I took it, so things might have changed) but I didn't think it was too math heavy (at most double integrals)

Take 412 over 250 and thank me later

Christian Wong | Computer Science Engineering & Business + Sustainability Minor
Honestly, I wish I took stats 250. 412 was the biggest waste of time and people say that it's easier than 250 but during my semester (w21) it was simply not easier at all. I looked at all of the stuff from 250 from that semester and it definitely looked easier than our 412 exams. 
________________


Francesca Delmolino | Data Science - LSA + Earth Sciences Minor
Take 203 first, the whole first exam is just 203 all over again. Took Winter 2022 alongside 281, definitely not a bad combo but the homeworks can sometimes just be a waste of time. Listen in lecture as she [Prof Fink] will sometimes tell you which problems to focus on for exam. Fink was quiet and sometimes hard to focus on but a very reasonable stats class. We didn’t use too much Calc 3 besides derivatives and basic integrals. Honestly a very “skippable” class if lectures are recorded. 


STATS 413: Linear Regression Analysis
Francesca Delmolino | Data Science - LSA + Earth Sciences Minor
Honestly one of the easiest “mathy” classes you need for Stats or Data Science. A breeze if you take it with Gongjun, super clear about the concepts and the homeworks are not bad. You can definitely do them in a night. This class had 2 exams and homeworks every other week. Exams were almost identical to the practice so look at those in advance and put them on your cheat sheet (if you’re allowed one). We had weekly labs and a lab assignment graded on effort, great intro to R if you don’t know it. Honestly, so applicable to real life uses of statistics and data science.  
STATS 426: Introduction to Theoretical Statistics
Fizza Ahmed | Data Science - LSA
Stats 426 is the worst don't take it if you don't have to.
IOE 265: Probability and Statistics for Engineers
Pibby Garrahan | Computer Science Engineering & Music Minor 
I took IOE 265! So easy but also was painfully boring to the point where I had no motivation to do any work. I didn't get anything out of the lectures, however I really did not need to do much to do well in it. Highly recommend because I do not think I could handle stats 250 with the eecs 280/203 combo.
________________
Anonymous | Computer Science Engineering & Applied Statistics Minor
For computer science engineering, IOE 265 covers the same prereqs as STATS 250 and is much easier. I took it W20 so the class may have changed but I can't see it having become more of a work load than STATS 250.
STATS 206: Introduction to Data Science
Anonymous | UX Design & Information Analysis
Taken during Fall 2021. I took STATS 206 and the course is new at U of M. I personally wasn't a fan because there aren't many resources on campus to get tutoring outside the course since it is new. I had Mark Fredickson as my professor and he was pretty nice and understanding. I wish that he gave more examples in class for us to show what we're learning though. I give the class a 7/10.

MATH
MATH 115: Calculus I
Sydney Bruce | UX Design & Business Minor
This was by far my least favorite class I have ever taken at this university. The class was basically teach yourself and having little to no knowledge on the subject matter made this class extremely difficult. This class is a pre-req for the business minor, but can also be subbed out for the lower calc class. Highly recommend getting a tutor if you have not taken any calc classes before.

Taken MATH 115 Fall 2019 and MATH 116 Winter 2020. Concepts could be interesting (this could also be due to me liking math), but the workload and exams were not fun. Team homework every week ended up being exhausting sometimes, and the exams are very short in time. Don’t get behind on material and try to ask all of your questions before they turn into a big snowball!
________________
Julie Frary | Information Analysis & Applied Statistics Minor
I took both 115 and 116 at Michigan and if I had any advice it would be to take it elsewhere. The material itself is not too bad, but the team homework and exams are unnecessarily hard. I struggled a lot with both of these classes and felt zero support from the teaching team. I barely passed.

Take this at a community college! Michigan math is no joke, and shouldn’t put chokehold on you or your work ethic. It’s required in most, if not all majors, and you have to really work to wrap your head around applying concepts even if you took AP Calc A and B in high school!

MATH 115 was annoying but doable here. If you're not majoring in math (or maybe engineering) don't take 116 here. I took it elsewhere and it set me up will for Calc 3 without all the unnecessary stress of michigan math. 
MATH 116: Calculus II
Anonymous | Computer Science Engineering
Your professor is everything, and people that have a good professor are at a crazy advantage since both these classes are taught in groups of 20 or something. Definitely utilize rate my professor, BUT be cautious about professors who have high scores but haven't taught 116 before. My professor was funny and students on RMP loved him, but he had previously only taught upper levels and he was not that great at stepping it down a bunch of notches. I did not have a good time

MATH 214: Applied Linear Algebra
Anonymous | Computer Science Engineering & Mathematics Minor
If you have a bad 214 professor, just read the textbook and go to another section of class or don't go at all anymore lol. I genuinely came out of the class feeling like I did not learn anything. I can do the mathematical operations, but I have no idea how to visualize most linear algebra so I don't really know what I learned which is a shame

Taken MATH 214 Fall 2020. It was definitely better than 115 or 116, with less stressful assignments and more flexibility such as a final group project, but still some hard concepts to grasp (especially visualizing 3D) and challenging exams.

Pretty easy class, at least during covid. Imo the concepts are all a bit more abstract and difficult to visualize, but it's pretty easy to memorize the processes you need to do and there's only so many kinds of questions they can ask so if you study for the exams you'll probably be fine. Taken with 281 and 376, but definitely easier than both of those. Honestly also easier than stats 412 and every other math-related class I have taken at UMich
________________


Francesca Delmolino | Data Science - LSA + Earth Sciences Minor
I loved 214 , don’t be scared to take it at umich! homeworks are pretty easy and as are the quizzes. Very manageable class in my opinion, with maybe an hour or so spent on homework a week (at the most). I took it with Minoccheri who was very responsive and helpful both in lecture (well paced and answered questions) and in OH. Final group project very flexible! Smaller group projects are a little more work and if you have a bad group (like I did) you’ll end up doing more work. 
MATH 215: Multivariable and Vector Calculus
Anonymous | Computer Science Engineering & Mathematics Minor
215 is a ton of work -- the gateways are tougher than 214 or 116 so make sure to get those out of the way early. The written homework was pretty tough for me and it took a long time to complete
________________


Annika Dahlmann | Data Science - LSA & Spanish
I took Math 215 Fall 2018. Personally, I was not a fan of this class. Given I was a freshmen and was still getting my bearings, I always felt like I was working so well and my homework/exams scores were not reflected in this. I would recommend taking this class after you really learn how to study in college (aka probably not freshmen year). My professor taught on a chalk board with no lecture notes or lecture recordings, so if you missed something in class you weren't able to get the material later. For me, this was not a productive way for me to learn because after class I always felt like I was too busy scrambling notes to have actually learned anything.
________________


Nish Reddy | Civil Engineering & Computer Science Minor
Taken during Fall 19. Tough class for sure, but manageable if you stay diligent. Start the written homework early so that you have time to go to office hours if you're stuck later in the week, because those office hours get busy really quickly. As always, prepare for exams early, and read the textbook if you need a better understanding of the concepts, because exam questions won't be just like the homework.

Pretty solid class if you liked calc 1. Pretty much just calc 1 but in more than two dimensions. Some of the concepts are little bit abstract at the end of the semester, but most of it can be visualized. Expect the professors to be terrible though and be prepared to self-teach a lot because it is, in fact, a UMich math class. Easier than math 216 according to a couple of friends who have taken both
________________


Francesca Delmolino | Data Science - LSA + Earth Sciences Minor
Great class! For those traumatized by Calc 2, this is wayyyy easier. I took it Fall 2020 as a freshman and it was very well paced. While the homeworks can sometimes take some time, make friends in the class and work on the hw’s together. Do all practice exams and go to office hours even if it’s just to listen. It helps if you are comfortable visualizing ideas in your head as some of the conceptual things may take some time to fully grasp.

MATH 217: Linear Algebra
Fizza Ahmed | Data Science - LSA & Mathematics
if you like math + proofs + working through conceptual problems with a group, then take this class. if you want to do anything data sciencey, i would recommend 217, it helps with upper-level stats classes. it's a flipped classroom, so you'll read the textbook at home and do problem sets in class. homeworks took me a while to figure out -- they're mostly proofs. 
________________


Evan Weissburg | Computer Science Engineering & Mathematics Minor
Great course if you like math. You will come away with a strong understanding of linear algebra, unlike MATH 214, and this will end up being surprisingly applicable to computer science and math courses in the future. There are two problem sets a week (A and B). Part A is numeric problems from a textbook, part B is all proofs. Part B takes much longer than part A. This course was around double the workload of EECS 376. After MATH 217, you can take MATH 297 (but don't), which will track you into the honors math track (Math 395/396).

Math 425 (crosslisted Stats 425) is a solid course in probability and statistics. I'd recommend since it's not too hard and you do learn a lot. The lectures are fairly good. Stats 426 (the natural successor) on the other hand is terrible: the lectures are garbage and I have never seen a worse-organized course. Prof is very nice but doesn't make any sense even when the Zoom is more than 1 FPS and the audio isn't garbled. It's a shame because the content is genuinely useful and interesting.
Math 297 is a difficult and time consuming course in analysis. Like Math 217 , the course is flipped classroom, so you spend 1.5 hours a week Mon/Wed/Fri working in small groups on worksheets. You will drown in homeworks -- there are 3 problem sets (A/B/C) a week, due Mon/Wed/Fri, and each one is similar to a weekly EECS 376 pset in workload. Part A covers material related to that which you see in class. Part B is (completely unrelated) linear algebra; in the first week, you recap key concepts of Math 217, then you see only new linear algebra content on homeworks (s/o to dual spaces, which still make zero sense). Part C is a random assortment of problems, including complex numbers, true/false, and "fun" little problems from other courses that DeBacker used to teach. If you truly love math (I realized this is not me), this could be the course for you -- it is cool to be in a small math class (~15 ppl) three times a week, since you meet a lot of interesting and passionate people this way. Also, Scott is dope.

Prof Springsteen for TC 300 is a pretty easy grader and doesn't assign too much work.

TC 300 is pretty easy/straight forward! Only a few major assignments (including resume which most of you will have at the point you take it!) I took it with Kim Lewis and she's very sweet/accommodating! I put almost no effort outside of the designated 1 hour and am doing well!

This class depends so much on the professor. I had a friend who basically showed up to class, turned in one paper, and got an A. I had to write like 3 or 4 7-8 page papers, and at the end of the semester had to record a video resource teaching students about professional development. I did get an A, because the teacher was a chill grader, but it was definitely more work than a 1 credit class. So make sure you check RMP and Atlas. The one good side to my professor, Lisa Grimble, was that she was the nicest human being I've met in a while. She let me resubmit an essay for a better grade because I went to go talk to her about it. Really sweet professor, really understanding.

I took techcomm 300 with Karen Springsteen. She is really awesome and I had a bad experience with my group because they would never respond to me when I would ask them to do something for the class but they would always respond when a male member of the group would ask them to do something (it was a group of all guys and me). It was really frustrating because I felt extremely ignored by my group/it was kind of the classic sexist scenario where the female in the group is ignored, but the professor was so nice to me about it and let me be on a team by myself. She also met with me and we talked about sexism in engineering!

I hate tech comm. It's a waste of time and they don't let you pick your groups.


TECHCOMM 497: Advanced Technical Communication for Electrical & Computer Science

Take 497 With Elyse Vigiletti. Not too much work, has been flexible with covid, and she set up the class in a way that I felt like I actually got something out of it. I didn't feel this way at all in tc 300 or engr 100's tc part.

I took 497 with Professor Vigiletti, I would HIGHLY recommend taking it with her if you can. She's really considerate, grades easily, and is really willing to help students with everything. Her rubrics and expectations are also really clear which is essential for a class like 497. In general, I would say just make sure you pick a good professor for 497 because that will pretty much define your experience in this class.

A ton of STEM minor classes double count as flex techs and minor requirements, especially math, and doing that is a good move.

Video game music is a great 2-credit course that's both fun and an easy A. Definitely recommend.
BIOINFORMATICS 527: Introduction to Bioinformatics
Annika Dahlmann | Data Science - LSA & Spanish
I took Bioinformatics 527 (Introduction to Bioinformatics) Fall 2020. I took this as a data science elective class and realllyyy liked it. I have always had an interest in the natural sciences so that definitely could contribute to why I liked this class so much. But this class is a grad level class so I thought it was going to be super cut throat, but it ended up being super chill. The professor was so so nice and helpful. We worked with him directly for our final project and he is very knowledgeable and willing to help (he met with us extra times because we wanted to ask questions/double check things). This class also has guest lecturers from experts in different fields to lecture on the topics that they are experts in.

I loved the class. I took this class my freshman year and absolutely loved it. It is a pretty easy A and very informative. The professors are very receptive and the topics covered in the class range from language to ethics and morality. It is a great class if you want an overview of what cognitive science entails. Also there is barely any coursework and the exams are pretty straightforward.

cogsci 200 was so fun I decided to make that my major lmaoooo. Take the class tho regardless of intention to major in it or not. It is super applicable to CS classes and just generally very interesting and not a heavy workload.
